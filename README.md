# Sentence Similarity Matching

**Description:**

This Python script implements a sentence similarity matching algorithm using Word2Vec embeddings and cosine similarity. It's designed to identify similar sentences within a given dataset.

**Requirements:**

* Python (3.6+)
* pandas
* NumPy
* NLTK
* Gensim
* Scikit-learn

**Installation:**

Create a virtual environment (recommended):
Bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

**Install required packages:**
Bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk gensim scikit-learn
 
**Usage:**

*Prepare your data:*

Create a CSV file named clean_mh.csv with a column named sentence containing the sentences you want to compare.

*Run the script:*
Execute the Python script.

*How it works:*

* Data Preprocessing:
Cleans and preprocesses the text data by removing stop words and applying stemming.

* Word Embeddings:
Creates word embeddings using Word2Vec to represent words as numerical vectors.

* Sentence Embedding:
Calculates sentence embeddings by averaging the word embeddings of the words in the sentence.

* Similarity Calculation:
Compares sentences using cosine similarity, a measure of similarity between vectors.

* Matching:
Identifies sentence pairs with a similarity score above a specified threshold.

* Customization:

* Threshold:
Adjust the similarity threshold to control the sensitivity of the matching process.

* Word Embedding Model:
Experiment with different Word2Vec models or pre-trained language models like BERT or RoBERTa.

* Similarity Metric:
Consider other similarity metrics like Euclidean distance or Jaccard similarity.

* Feature Engineering:
Incorporate additional features like n-grams, part-of-speech tags, or named entity recognition to improve matching accuracy

**Note:**

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed and the CSV file in the correct location.
For more advanced sentence similarity tasks, consider using deep learning techniques and transfer learning.
